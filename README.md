Covid Tracker

Manage covid test results by adding and removing values in an array, and by getting statistics about the population.

Description

This project allows a user to manage medical tests by sorting positive and negative tests into separate arrays. You are also able to print population statistics such as the total amount of positive and negative tests, and the positivity rate. Finally, you can print data about an individual's testing records.
